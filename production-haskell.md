I'm working on a book titled "Production Haskell."
When it is complete, it will be the handbook I wish I had when I was developing commercial applications to solve business goals.
You'll learn how to apply functional programming principles to business logic problems, you'll learn how to evaluate Haskell libraries, and you'll learn how to avoid common pitfalls with using Haskell in industry.

To get updates on the book's progress, follow [@prodhaskell](https://twitter.com/prodhaskell) on Twitter!
