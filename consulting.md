So you enjoy my blogposts or open source work, and you'd like some help with some Haskell.
I'm available for consulting.
I can help in a variety of ways:

# Architecture

Are you unsure how to structure your Haskell application on a high level?
I can provide guidance on this, offering advice and experience on library selection and trade-offs between various approaches.

# Implementation

Are you stuck on your implementation?
I can help get you un-stuck and productive again with a quick call.
You can also set me up as a contributor on your project for very quick fixes.

Unfortunately, I do not have the spare bandwidth to do significant implementation work at this time.

# Tutoring

Do you want to learn more about a specific Haskell topic?
I can provide tutoring on a wide variety of things, from fancy type level stuff to low-level performance concerns.

# Documentation

Is there a topic you'd like me to write on?
I can write tutorials, library documentation, and friendly introductions to advanced topics.

# Get in touch!

If you are interested, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:parsonsmatt+consult@gmail.com">parsonsmatt@gmail.com</a>.

My bandwidth is currently somewhat constrained, and I'm only available on small projects.
However, I know many folks that can help with a variety of projects that are available to help.
If I'm unable to help you, then I can help connect you with someone that can.
